    <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>

    <p>A frozen strawberry treat you can't put down, but is a little messy to make.</p>

    <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Walnuts</li>
      <li>Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Brown sugar</li>
      <li>Egg whites</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Lemon Juice</li>
      <li>White sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, walnuts and melted butter.</li>
      <li>Toast in the oven until walnuts are fragrant, about 15 minutes; stir occasionally. Sprinkle 2/3 of the walnut mixture evenly over the bottom of the 9x13 inch dish.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with the lemon juice until they can hold a soft peak.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off; let cheesecake cool in the oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours to prevent cracking.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whip the cream with an electric mixer until stiff but not grainy. Fold into the strawberry mixture. Spoon over the crust in the dish and spread evenly.</li>
      <li>Top with the remaining walnut mixture. Freeze for 6 hours, or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
